# Potato Blast
2D game where you are programming a cannon to blast falling potatoes using ammo shot vertically from the ground. You need to avoid the falling potatoes, because they will destroy your cannon if they fall on it.

## üé≤ Game rules
The game starts with you in control of a potato-killing fryer. Potatoes fall from the sky and try to kill you by hitting you, so avoid them and fry them by shooting oil at them. If you're unlucky enough to get hit by one, it's game over.

## üéÆ Use cases
-Move fryer horizontally to avoid the potatoes when they fall on the ground
-Blast oil vertically on potatoes
-Damage the potatoes that are bouncing vertically on the map
-Gather power-ups randomly when potatoes get destroyed (freeze, double shoot, invincibility)
-Earn score by destroying potatoes
-Die when a potato lands on the fryer
-Respawn a short time after dying 
-Respawn the potatoes a short time after they get blasted
-Challenge your friends in real time
-Compare your best score to the leaderboard

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites
-Computer
-An IDE for developing in Python
-Python
-Internet connection
